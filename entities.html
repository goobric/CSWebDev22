    <h1>Entity Codes</h1>
    <p>
      there are a number of characters that are reserved for HTML, which are
      used as the foundation of the mark-up
    </p>
    <p>these symbols have <strong>entity</strong> codes associated with them</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      it is best practice <strong>not</strong> to use these symbols as stand
      alone characters direct from the keyboard; but their associated code.
    </p>
    <p>
      this helps text editors, like vscode, compile the HTML instructions
      correctly; as well as the browser rendering the HTML instructions to the
      screen as intended.
