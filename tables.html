    <h1>Tables</h1>
    <h2>what are tables?</h2>
    <p>
      Tables are structured sets of data, made up of rows and columns, known as
      a two dimensional structure. They can be a useful way of displaying data
      clearly.
    </p>
    <h2>Early Usage</h2>
    <p>
      In the early days of the world-wide-web, tables were commonly used to
      create page layouts. Now tables should only the
      <strong>table</strong> elements to display actual data
    </p>
    <h2>Lots of Elements</h2>
    <p>
      To create a table of data, 5-10 different <strong>table</strong> elements
      are available to use. These are listed in the table below
    </p>
    <p>
      tabular data held within a <strong>table</strong> is not very accessible.
      Therefore, table semantic elements are used. These assist screen readers.
    </p>
    <h3>A list of table elements</h3>
    <!-- <table> <thead> <tbody> <tfoot> <tr> <td> <th> <colgroup> <caption> <dd> -->
    <!-- < &#60; > &#62;-->
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td>Table Element</td>
          <td>Description</td>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>&#60;table&#62;</td>
          <td>
            top level element, similar to the &#60;html&#62; element in meaning,
            but for the table.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&#60;thead&#62;</td>
          <td>
            similar to the &#60;header&#62; element in meaning, but for the
            description of each column within the table.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&#60;tbody&#62;</td>
          <td>
            similar to the &#60;body&#62; element in meaning, but for the table.
            Which holds the main data that is being displayed.
          </td>
        </tr>
