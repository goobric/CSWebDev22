    <h1>BTCC British Touring Car Championship</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Early years The Austin A105 with which Jack Sears won the 1958 British
      Saloon Car Championship
    </p>
    <p>
      The championship was initially run with a mix of classes, divided
      according to engine capacity, racing simultaneously. This often meant that
      a driver who chose the right class could win the overall championship
      without any chance of overall race wins, thereby devaluing the title for
      the spectators – for example, in the 1980s Chris Hodgetts won two overall
      titles in a small Toyota Corolla prepared by Hughes Of Beaconsfield, at
      that time a Mercedes-Benz/Toyota main dealer when most of the race wins
      were going to much larger cars; and while the Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500s
      were dominating at the front of the field, Frank Sytner took a title in a
      Class B BMW M3 and John Cleland's first title was won in a small Class C
      Vauxhall Astra.

    <h3>Modern Era</h3>
    <h4>Super Touring Cars</h4>
    <p>
      Ford won the championship in 2000, the final year running Super Touring
      regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1990, the BTCC introduced a class for cars with an engine displacement
      up to 2.0 litres which would later be adopted by the Fédération
      Internationale de l'Automobile and become the Super Touring regulations
      that were used in various championships in Europe and around the world. In
      their first year, these cars were run alongside a second class which
      continued to allow larger engines and was once again dominated by the Ford
      Sierra Cosworth RS500, however from 1991 they became the only cars
      eligible to compete. The new one-class system was popular with
      manufacturers from the beginning with six manufacturer supported teams
      from BMW, Ford, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Vauxhall entered in the
      championship. During the first seasons, the cars were not fitted with
      aerodynamic aids such as a front splitter or a rear wing which were
      allowed from 1995 after Alfa Romeo caused controversy a year earlier, when
      they entered the 155 fitted with a rear wing – an item that was delivered
      with the road-going version of the 155, however unfitted in its boot. Audi
      joined the BTCC in 1996 with its four-wheel drive A4 Quattro, and went on
      to take that year's title.[2] The continuously high number of
      manufacturer-backed teams meant rapid development on the cars and quickly
      growing costs to compete which caused several manufacturers to withdraw
      from the championship until the 2000 season, when only Ford, Honda and
      Vauxhall remained in the championship. To this day, the 'super touring
      era' during the 1990s is still looked at as the most successful period of
      the BTCC. The high number of manufacturer-backed teams provided very close
      competition, close and hard-fought racing on track and many spectators at
      the circuits.[3]
