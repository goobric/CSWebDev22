    <h1>BTCC British Touring Car Championship</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Early years The Austin A105 with which Jack Sears won the 1958 British
      Saloon Car Championship
    </p>
    <p>
      The championship was initially run with a mix of classes, divided
      according to engine capacity, racing simultaneously. This often meant that
      a driver who chose the right class could win the overall championship
      without any chance of overall race wins, thereby devaluing the title for
      the spectators â€“ for example, in the 1980s Chris Hodgetts won two overall
      titles in a small Toyota Corolla prepared by Hughes Of Beaconsfield, at
      that time a Mercedes-Benz/Toyota main dealer when most of the race wins
      were going to much larger cars; and while the Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500s
      were dominating at the front of the field, Frank Sytner took a title in a
      Class B BMW M3 and John Cleland's first title was won in a small Class C
      Vauxhall Astra.
